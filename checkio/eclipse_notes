git:

*  you always work with branches,  anything in the master is always deployable.
* your branch name sould be descriptive ( ie. user-content-cache-key ) 

* Pull request - initiates dicusion about your commits:
		* user when you want someone to review your work
		* user when you need help
		* start peer review
		
* mike, looks like there is a couple different models:
		* Fork and Pull
		* Shared Repository
		
* you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. 
  If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying 
  the existing master into production.
  
* once changes have been verified in production its time to merge your
  code into master branch.
