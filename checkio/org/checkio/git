FYI a normal usage of GIT would be the Following

1.	Check out Trunk
2.	Branch Trunk
3.	Push Branch
4.	Code Feature
5.	Fetch updated trunk
6.	Merge trunk into branche
7.	Push branch
8.	Test before merge into trunk  ( intergration )
9.	Merge into trunk, (usualy with peer code review)
10.	Clean up Working Environment
11.	Start Over


* never work of master, check it out them branch. 
  you only merge to master, you don't edit on the master.
