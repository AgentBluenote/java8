Titan came with 2 sets of keys. ( 4 keys )
( One of the keys is like the Valet key which can 
 NOT open the Console or the Glove box.   

2 - I kept my spare keys in some jewery box. 
    When I needed my spare keys after my job 
    with RSystems ended back in the beginning
    of Jan. 2011. I could NOT find them. 

    I remember I had a Catipillar Master to  
    to some Scraper that Daven gave me. 

    The spare set of keys would have been with that key. 
    which I could not find either. 

    When I was Manic I thought that Joe or one of
    His Quixtar buddy's took it. 

2.  I lost my Boost Lanyard, my "Lucky Piston" 
    and my keys Right there on Ramona st.
